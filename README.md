# SEEKER-encoding-and-decoding
Complete encoding and decoding process compatible with SEEKER for keyword search in DNA data storage


  This branch contains step-by-step procedures to implement the entire process from encoding text data to DNA sequences and decode sequencing reads to readable texts.
  The codes are written in Jupyter Notebook with a Python 3 kernel. Please directly download the zip file from 
  Please follow the order of steps for a successful reproduction of the NCG encoding and decoding. 
  For the generation of reference and data DNA sequences (step 3 and 4), we built codes both for the reproducibility of our results using existing text data to be encoded (provided in this branch) and for customers with their own text data.
